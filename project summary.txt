                                Project Summary
    
    For this final project, I have created an interactive pet simulator using C++. I used a
class called "Pet" to store the pet's data, such as hunger, thirst, happiness, sleepiness, 
and level. The action functions and algorithms, such as play, eat, sleep, and drink, are 
stored in the Pet.cpp file. Upon start-up, you will be prompted to create a pet and assign it
with a name. Then, you will be able to choose an action (from a list of options), which 
corresponds to the Pet.cpp action functions. Additionally, you will be given the option to 
check your pet's status, which displays a list of your pet's data (as defined in the Pet 
class). The Pet's status is affected by time (Ex. As time passes, your pet will grow hungrier
and more tired). I used the chrono library *{with the help of ChatGPT}*, to track the time as
it passes and update your pet's status accordingly. Lastly, I chose to implement a basic level 
system to track your pet's progress throughout the game.
