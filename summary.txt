                                Project Summary
    
    For this final project, I have began to create the outline of my Arduino-based pet 
simulator using C++. So far, I have created my Pet.h file and Pet.cpp file. I used a 
class called "Pet" to store the pet's data, such as hunger, thirst, happiness, and 
sleepiness levels. Next, I plan to develop the action functions and algorithms in the 
Pet.cpp file.
